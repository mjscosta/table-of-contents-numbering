# table-of-contents-numbering
Open Source Google Docs add-on to support numbering of table headings of contents in Google Docs.

This project aims to provide an open source version of the "Table Of Contents" add-on available on Google Docs, that is under closed source, and thus not trusted for my personal or company use.

Contributions and improvements are wellcome.
